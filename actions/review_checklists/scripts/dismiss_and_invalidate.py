"""Invalidate OK acknowledgements.

This script handles two scenarios:

1. **New push (synchronize)**: When new commits are pushed to the PR, we
   determine which checklist paths are affected by the *new* changes.  For
   each affected checklist, all existing OK replies are deleted and the
   commit status is set back to pending.  Approvals are **not** dismissed
   here — branch rulesets handle dismissing stale reviews on new pushes.

2. **OK modified or deleted**: When a reviewer edits or deletes their OK
   comment, the commit status is set back to pending so the checklist
   must be re-acknowledged.  The reviewer's approval is **not** dismissed.

The script is invoked with a ``--trigger`` argument:

    python dismiss_and_invalidate.py --trigger synchronize
    python dismiss_and_invalidate.py --trigger comment_changed
