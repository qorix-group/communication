"""Invalidate OK acknowledgements after a new push.

This script runs on every ``pull_request_target`` sub-event (opened,
reopened, synchronize, edited) — the apply workflow does not need to know
which one fired.  It determines which checklist paths are affected by
commits introduced since the previous trigger run, and for each affected
checklist deletes all existing OK replies and sets the commit status back
to pending.  Approvals are **not** dismissed here — branch rulesets handle
dismissing stale reviews on new pushes.

When the head SHA hasn't actually moved since the previous trigger run
(e.g. on "edited"/"reopened" without a new push), the diff against that
previous run's head SHA is empty, so no checklists are affected and this
is a no-op — no separate signal for "was this actually a push" is needed.

(OK-comment edits/deletions no longer need dedicated handling here: the
"check" action already re-scans the current comment state on every
invocation, so an edited/deleted OK comment is naturally no longer
counted the next time acknowledgements are checked.)

The "files changed since the previous trigger run" are found without
needing the ``before``/``after`` SHAs from the original event payload:
this script looks up the previous run of the "Review Checklists
(Trigger)" workflow for the same head branch (ordered by run creation
time) and uses that run's head SHA as the "before" commit.  This keeps
stage 1 → stage 2 data transfer at zero while still comparing against
exactly the commits introduced since the last time this ran.
