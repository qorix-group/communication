"""Verify that all relevant checklists have been acknowledged by every approving
reviewer, and set the commit status accordingly.

An acknowledgement is a reply in the threaded conversation of a checklist
review comment (finding) that contains the ``OK`` keyword.  This script:

1. Ensures the merge-queue notice (comment + PR description) is present if
   the PR is currently enqueued in the merge queue.
2. Enumerates relevant checklists for the PR.
3. For each checklist, finds the bot-posted review comment and its OK replies.
4. Builds a mapping: checklist-id → set of reviewers who said OK.
5. Compares against the set of approving reviewers.
6. Sets commit status to *success* only when every approving reviewer has
   acknowledged every relevant checklist.  Otherwise sets *pending* or
   *failure*.

This script is invoked on every checklist-relevant event (it is always the
last step run), so it doubles as the single, fully stateless source of
truth for acknowledgement status: it always re-scans the current live
comment state rather than relying on which specific event triggered it.

For ``merge_group`` events it does not merely assume the evidence is still
valid because a required status check passed at some earlier point: it
resolves the underlying pull request and re-runs the same acknowledgement
validation against its current live state, setting the commit status on
the merge-queue's merge-commit SHA. This closes the window between when
the PR's own check last went green and when it actually entered the queue
(and rejects entries where that PR can no longer be resolved at all).
