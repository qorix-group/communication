# Coverage Infrastructure

This directory contains the tooling to generate, post-process, and report C++ code coverage for the Score Communication project. It supports two platforms:
- **Linux**: LLVM source-based coverage (`llvm-cov`)
- **QNX**: gcov-based coverage via gcovr

## Requirements

The coverage pipeline was built to satisfy the following requirements:

### REQ-COV-001: Native llvm-cov HTML Reports

Coverage reports **must** be generated directly by `llvm-cov show` using LLVM's source-based coverage (`--experimental_use_llvm_covmap`). No intermediate LCOV-to-HTML conversion (genhtml) is used. This provides accurate source-level coverage including branch and expansion views.

### REQ-COV-002: Instrumentation Filtering

Only project source code under `//score/message_passing` and `//score/mw/com` shall be instrumented and reported. Tests, benchmarks, and external/third-party code must be excluded from the report.

> **Note:** `--experimental_use_llvm_covmap` causes Bazel to instrument ALL targets regardless of `--instrumentation_filter`. Actual source filtering is enforced by `--ignore-filename-regex` in the merger and reporter. See `coverage.bazelrc` for details.

### REQ-COV-003: Coverage Justification Infrastructure

A YAML-based justification system must allow developers to "argue" non-covered lines and branches to achieve 100% effective coverage. Justified lines must:
- Be tracked in a central YAML file with unique IDs, categories, and rationale
- Optionally be referenced from code via `COV_JUSTIFIED` markers
- Appear visually distinct (yellow/orange) in the HTML report
- Be reflected in both per-file and total coverage percentages

### REQ-COV-004: Effective Coverage Calculation

The system must calculate and display:
- **Raw coverage**: actual lines/branches hit ÷ total instrumented lines/branches
- **Effective coverage**: (hit + justified) ÷ total

Both line and branch effective coverage must be shown in the summary, per-file index table, and totals row.

### REQ-COV-005: Stale Justification Detection

Justifications for lines/branches that are actually covered by tests must be detected and reported as stale warnings, enabling cleanup.

### REQ-COV-006: Template Instantiation Handling

For C++ templates with multiple instantiations, a line or branch is considered "covered" if ANY instantiation covers it (consistent with llvm-cov semantics). This prevents inflated totals from repeated template expansions.

### REQ-COV-007: Threshold Enforcement

The pipeline must support a configurable effective coverage threshold (default: 100%) and emit a warning when coverage falls below it.

## Quick Start

### 1. Run Coverage Collection

```bash
# Full project (Linux, LLVM source-based coverage)
bazel coverage //...

# Full project (QNX x86_64, gcov-based coverage)
bazel coverage //score/... --config=qnx

# Specific target (Linux)
bazel coverage //score/message_passing:client_connection_test

# Specific target (QNX)
bazel coverage --config=qnx //score/message_passing:client_connection_test
```

### 2. Generate the HTML Report

```bash
# Linux coverage report (default)
bazel run //quality/coverage:generate_coverage_html

# QNX coverage report
bazel run //quality/coverage:generate_coverage_html -- --platform qnx
```

For Linux (LLVM pipeline), the custom reporter produces a zip with an HTML report directly.
For QNX (gcov pipeline), the script first resolves the collected coverage allowlist, then converts the LCOV data to HTML using `lcov_to_html.py` (which internally uses gcovr).

The report is written to `cpp_coverage/` (Linux) or `cpp_coverage_qnx/` (QNX). Open it:

```bash
# Linux
xdg-open cpp_coverage_linux/index.html

# QNX
xdg-open cpp_coverage_qnx/index.html
```

### 3. Create an Archive (CI)

```bash
# Linux
bazel run //quality/coverage:generate_coverage_html -- --archive coverage-report

# QNX
bazel run //quality/coverage:generate_coverage_html -- --platform qnx --archive coverage-report-qnx
```

Creates a zip archive containing the HTML report, LCOV data, and JUnit XML test results.

## Coverage Pipelines

The project supports two coverage pipelines depending on the target platform:

| Pipeline | Config | Compiler | Tool | HTML Generation |
|----------|--------|----------|------|-----------------|
| **LLVM** (Linux) | *(default)* | Clang/LLVM | llvm-cov, llvm-profdata | Custom reporter (llvm-cov show) |
| **gcov** (QNX) | `--config=qnx` | QCC (GCC-based) | gcov | lcov_to_html.py (gcovr) |

## Pipeline Architecture

The coverage pipeline has two phases. Phase 1 differs by platform; Phase 2 is shared.

### Phase 1: Bazel Coverage Collection

**LLVM pipeline** (Linux, default):

```
bazel coverage //...
    │
    ├── Per-test: merger.py (--coverage_output_generator)
    │   • Receives .profraw files from test execution
    │   • Merges into .profdata via llvm-profdata
    │   • Packages profdata + metadata into a zip
    │
    └── Final: reporter.py (--coverage_report_generator)
        • Merges per-test profdata artifacts into a single merged profdata and uses `llvm-cov --empty-profile` for baseline-only archives.
        • Runs llvm-cov show → HTML report
        • Runs llvm-cov export → LCOV data
        • Runs llvm-cov report → text summary
        • Packages everything into _coverage_report.dat (zip)
```

**gcov pipeline** (QNX, `--config=qnx`):

```
bazel coverage //score/... --config=qnx
    │
    ├── Per-test: Bazel default merger
    │   • Runs gcov on .gcda/.gcno files
    │   • Produces LCOV data per test
    │
    └── Final: Bazel default reporter
        • Merges all per-test LCOV data
        • Writes combined LCOV to _coverage_report.dat (text)
```

### Phase 2: Report Extraction & Justification

```
bazel run //quality/coverage:generate_coverage_html [-- --platform <linux|qnx>]
    │
    └── generate_coverage_html.sh
        ├── Detect format: zip (LLVM) or LCOV text (gcov)
        ├── LLVM: Extract HTML from zip → cpp_coverage_linux/
        │   gcov: Build collected allowlist + merge baseline_coverage.dat inputs → convert LCOV → HTML via lcov_to_html.py (gcovr) → cpp_coverage_qnx/
        ├── justify.py: YAML + code markers → manifest.json
        ├── effective_coverage.py: Post-process HTML + calculate effective %
        └── Print summary + threshold check
```

For QNX, the allowlist from `quality/coverage:coverage_scope` is the authoritative file scope for the HTML report. Regex-based file filters are no longer used in that path.

## Configuration

### coverage.bazelrc

The configuration is split into platform-agnostic settings (applied globally) and
platform-specific sections:

**Platform-agnostic flags** (apply to all coverage runs):

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--instrumentation_filter` | Documents intended scope |
| `--cxxopt=-O0` | Disable optimizations for accurate coverage |
| `--dynamic_mode=off` | Static linking to avoid coverage conflicts |

**LLVM-specific flags** (Linux, default):

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--experimental_use_llvm_covmap` | Use LLVM source-based coverage (not gcov) |
| `--coverage_output_generator` | Points to `merger.py` for per-test processing |
| `--coverage_report_generator` | Points to `reporter.py` for final aggregation |
| `--test_env=LLVM_PROFILE_CONTINUOUS_MODE=1` | Enables profiling of abnormal terminations |
| `-mllvm -runtime-counter-relocation` | Required for continuous-mode profiling with LLVM |

**QNX-specific flags** (`--config=qnx`):

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--noexperimental_fetch_all_coverage_outputs` | Disables tree artifact validation (avoids dangling gcov symlink) |

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD` | `100` | Minimum effective line coverage % (warning if below) |

## Coverage Justifications

See [`coverage_justifications.yaml`](coverage_justifications.yaml) for the justification database and [`llvm_cov/README.md`](llvm_cov/README.md) for detailed documentation of the justification tools.

### Adding a Justification

1. **Via YAML** — add an entry to `coverage_justifications.yaml`:

```yaml
justifications:
  - id: my-unique-id              # kebab-case, must be unique
    category: defensive_programming  # or: tool_false_positive, platform_specific, other
    platforms: [linux, qnx]        # required: choose one or more target platforms
    reason: >
      Explanation of why these lines cannot be covered by tests.
    locations:
      - file: score/mw/com/impl/some_file.cpp
        line_start: 42
        line_end: 45
```

2. **Via code markers** — reference the ID from source (no `locations` needed in YAML):

```cpp
unreachable_code();  // COV_JUSTIFIED my-unique-id

// COV_JUSTIFIED_START my-unique-id
defensive_block();
more_defensive_code();
// COV_JUSTIFIED_STOP
```

Both methods can be combined. A justification covers both the line and any branches on that line.

We strongly suggest though to use the in-code marker where possible, as this better supports refactorings and avoids
better that justifications get outdated.

### Justification Categories

| Category | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| `defensive_programming` | Unreachable code kept as safety guard (e.g., default case in exhaustive switch) |
| `tool_false_positive` | Coverage tool incorrectly marks line as uncovered |
| `platform_specific` | Code path only reachable on platforms not under test |
| `other` | Any other valid reason |

### Platform Scoping

Each justification must specify which platforms it applies to via the `platforms` field:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `[linux]` | Only applies when generating Linux coverage |
| `[qnx]` | Only applies when generating QNX coverage |
| `[linux, qnx]` | Applies to both platforms |

The `--platform` argument to `generate_coverage_html.sh` controls which justifications are included.

### Visual Indicators in HTML Report

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Green** | Covered by tests |
| **Red** | Not covered (needs tests or justification) |
| **Yellow/Orange** | Justified — not covered but argued with rationale |

The index page shows a banner with overall effective coverage and updates per-file percentages in the table to reflect justifications.
