"""
Coverage scope rule for deriving file-level allowlists from dependable_element structure.

This rule uses an aspect to traverse the build graph starting from
dependable_element _index targets, through component and unit targets, into
their implementation cc_library targets (and their transitive deps). At each
cc_library, it collects the actual source files (srcs + hdrs).

The resulting allowlist contains one source file path per line (relative to the
workspace root). The coverage reporter uses this to restrict reports to exactly
the files that are part of a dependable_element's implementation.

Rust support: rust_library targets provide CcInfo (their rlib is exposed as a
.a symlink) and their .rs files come from the srcs attribute, so the CcInfo
branch covers them. rust_binary targets provide no CcInfo; a dedicated
CrateInfo branch collects their sources and the coverage-built executable.
