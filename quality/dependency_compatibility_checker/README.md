# Dependency Compatibility Checker

A config-driven tool that tests combinations of external dependency versions (and
Bazel versions) against the root `MODULE.bazel`, classifies each combination as
green / orange / red, and produces an HTML + JSON report.

## Config format (`config.yaml`)

`config.yaml` is the single source of truth for the matrix. It lists one entry per
dependency, each with the versions to test:

```yaml
dependencies:
  bazel:                       # special: drives USE_BAZEL_VERSION, not a MODULE dep
    versions:
      - version: "8.5.1"
  rules_cc:
    versions:
      - version: "0.2.17"
      - version: "0.2.21"
        patches:
          - "//third_party/rules_cc:some.patch"
        patch_strip: 1
```

- `bazel` is a special pseudo-dependency: it drives `USE_BAZEL_VERSION` for the CI
  matrix instead of a `MODULE.bazel` override, and may not carry `patches` or
  `patch_strip`.
- Every other dependency key maps to a Bazel module (`module_name` defaults to the
  key; set it explicitly if the module name differs from the config key).
- Each version entry may optionally carry:
  - `patches` / `patch_strip` — applied via `single_version_override` whenever that
    version is selected.
  - `flags` — extra Bazel flags added for that version.
  - `skip: "<reason with ticket>"` — disables the version but keeps it in the file
    for traceability. A dependency must always have at least one non-skipped
    version.

## Commands

- **`generate_matrix`** — expands `config.yaml` into the CI matrix (one entry per
  combination of active versions) plus a list of skipped versions.

  ```bash
  bazel run //quality/dependency_compatibility_checker:generate_matrix -- \
    --config "$PWD/quality/dependency_compatibility_checker/config.yaml"
  ```

- **`module_rewriter`** — rewrites the root `MODULE.bazel` for one combination:
  removes any existing override block for each non-`bazel` dependency and appends a
  fresh `single_version_override(...)`, including `patches`/`patch_strip` when
  configured. Idempotent.

  ```bash
  bazel run //quality/dependency_compatibility_checker:module_rewriter -- \
    --module-file "$PWD/MODULE.bazel" \
    --config "$PWD/quality/dependency_compatibility_checker/config.yaml" \
    --combination-json '{"bazel":"8.7.0","rules_cc":"0.2.21","index":0,"has_patches":false,"flags":""}'
  ```

- **`generate_report`** — aggregates the per-combination result JSONs produced by CI
  into `report.html` and `summary.json`.

  ```bash
  bazel run //quality/dependency_compatibility_checker:generate_report -- \
    --results-dir <dir-of-result-jsons> \
    --config "$PWD/quality/dependency_compatibility_checker/config.yaml" \
    --output-dir <output-dir>
  ```

## Classification

| Build passes? | Patches configured for the combination? | Result   |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|----------|
| yes           | no                                          | 🟢 green  |
| yes           | yes                                         | 🟠 orange |
| no            | any                                         | 🔴 red    |

- **green** — fully compatible, no patches required. Extra Bazel flags are allowed
  and do not downgrade a combination from green.
- **orange** — only compatible when the configured patches are applied.
- **red** — does not build at all.

Patches are always applied when configured; they are never applied reactively on
failure. Classification is a pure function of `(build_status, has_patches)`.

## Adding or skipping a version

- **Add a version:** add a new entry under the dependency's `versions` list in
  `config.yaml`, with `patches`/`patch_strip`/`flags` if needed.
- **Skip a version:** add `skip: "<reason with ticket>"` to the entry instead of
  deleting it, so the history stays visible. A dependency must keep at least one
  active (non-skipped) version.

## Running the tests

```bash
bazel test //quality/dependency_compatibility_checker/tests/... --test_output=errors
```
