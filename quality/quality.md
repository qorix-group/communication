# Quality Tools

This document provides instructions for developers on how to execute the quality tools available in Score (Clang-Tidy, CodeQL, Coverage, Sanitizers, Copyright Checker, and C++, Bazel Files Formatter) locally.

## Clang-Tidy

Clang-Tidy performs static analysis using a set of checks configured in the root [`.clang-tidy`](../.clang-tidy) file. It is integrated into Bazel via `@aspect_rules_lint` and uses the LLVM toolchain's clang-tidy binary.

### Running Clang-Tidy

```bash
# Check all targets
bazel test --config=clang-tidy //...

# Check a specific target or subtree
bazel test --config=clang-tidy //score/message_passing:client_connection_test
bazel test --config=clang-tidy //score/message_passing/...
```

The enabled check groups are: `bugprone-*`, `cert-*`, `clang-analyzer-*`, `cppcoreguidelines-*`, `fuchsia-*`, `google-*`, `hicpp-*`, `misc-*`, `modernize-*`, `performance-*`, and `readability-*`. The checks are organized into AUTOSAR severity-one, AUTOSAR severity-two, CERT, and QNX categories — see the [`.clang-tidy`](../.clang-tidy) file for the full list.

> **Note:** Only `clang-analyzer-*` findings are treated as errors. All other check groups produce warnings.

### Applying Auto-Fixes

Many clang-tidy checks can suggest machine-applicable fixes (e.g. `modernize-*`, `readability-*`)see the [`.clang-tidy`](../.) file for the full list.
Use the `clang-tidy.fix` target to run clang-tidy in fix mode and apply patches to the source tree:

```bash
# Check all targets (convenience wrapper)
bazel run //:clang-tidy.check
# Fix all targets
bazel run //:clang-tidy.fix

# Fix a specific target or subtree
bazel run //:clang-tidy.fix -- //score/message_passing:client_connection_test
bazel run //:clang-tidy.fix -- //score/message_passing/...
```

Internally this runs `bazel test --config=clang-tidy-fix`, collects the
`*.AspectRulesLintClangTidy.patch` files produced by `aspect_rules_lint`, and applies them with
`git apply`. Review and stage the result before committing:

```bash
git diff        # review what was changed
git add -p      # interactively stage hunks
```

> **Note:** Only checks that have an automatic fix produce patches. Violations without a fix
> (e.g. `clang-analyzer-*`) are still reported in the terminal but leave no patch file.

## CodeQL (MISRA C++)

CodeQL performs MISRA C++ compliance checking using the `codeql/misra-cpp-coding-standards` query pack (version pinned in [`quality/static_analysis/config.yaml`](static_analysis/config.yaml)). The analysis builds a CodeQL database from the Bazel build and runs the configured queries against it.

The script supports two reusable phases that can be run independently:

1. **Database creation** — compiles the codebase with CodeQL tracing and produces a reusable database.
2. **Analysis** — runs CodeQL queries against an existing database.

### Running CodeQL (all-in-one)

```bash
bazel run //quality/static_analysis:codeql_lint -- --target=//...
```

To analyze a specific target:

```bash
bazel run //quality/static_analysis:codeql_lint -- --target=//score/message_passing/...
```

This command automatically creates the database, generates SARIF, and creates 4 compliance reports in one step.

### Automatic Compliance Report Generation

When CodeQL analysis completes, MISRA C++ compliance reports are **automatically generated** using the `analysis_report` tool.

Reports are automatically generated for all analysis modes:
- `--phase all` (default)
- `--phase analyze-database` (when analyzing existing database)

The complete pipeline creates:

1. **CodeQL Database** — Analyzed code structure
   - Location: `bazel-out/codeql_database/` (persistent)

2. **SARIF File** — Machine-readable analysis results (JSON)
   - Location: `bazel-out/codeql.sarif`

3. **Markdown Reports** — Human-readable compliance documents (4 files)
   - Location: `bazel-out/analysis_reports/`

#### Run CodeQL with Automatic Reports (Recommended)

**Analyze a specific target with full automatic report generation:**

```bash
bazel run //quality/static_analysis:codeql_lint -- --target=//score/message_passing
```

This single command automatically:
1. Creates CodeQL database
2. Generates SARIF file (JSON with 274+ findings)
3. Generates 4 Markdown reports from SARIF + database

The markdown reports are written to `bazel-out/analysis_reports/` for local runs.
When `--output-dir` is used, they are written to `<output-dir>/analysis_reports/` instead.
In CI, the nightly workflow copies that directory into `/tmp/codeql-results/analysis_reports/`
before publishing the artifact.

#### Generated Reports

The following markdown files are automatically created in `bazel-out/analysis_reports/`:

- **database_integrity_report.md** — Database validation
  - Extraction errors (if any)
  - Successfully extracted files
  - Database health status

- **deviations_report.md** — MISRA compliance waivers
  - Deviation records and permits
  - Approved exceptions from standards
  - Justification and background

- **guideline_compliance_summary.md** — Executive summary
  - **Result**: Compliant or Non-Compliant
  - Total issues and violations
  - Rules triggered

- **guideline_recategorizations_report.md** — Rule recategorizations
  - Applied guideline recategorizations
  - Category remappings

> **Note:** `bazel-out` is a **symlink** into the Bazel cache (`~/.cache/bazel/.../bazel-out`),
> not a real folder inside the repository. VS Code's Explorer and `find` do not traverse it by
> default, so the reports may not appear in the sidebar even though they exist on disk. Use `ls`
> (not `find`) to list them, since `find` skips the symlink unless you pass `-L`.


## Coverage

Code coverage is generated using LLVM's source-based coverage instrumentation. The instrumentation filter is configured in [`quality/coverage/coverage.bazelrc`](coverage/coverage.bazelrc) to cover `//score/message_passing` and `//score/mw/com` while excluding test and benchmark code.

HTML reports are generated directly by `llvm-cov show`.

For detailed documentation of the pipeline architecture, tools, and requirements, see [`quality/coverage/README.md`](coverage/README.md) and [`quality/coverage/llvm_cov/README.md`](coverage/llvm_cov/README.md).

### Running Coverage

```bash
bazel coverage //...
```

To run coverage for a specific target:

```bash
bazel coverage //score/message_passing:client_connection_test_linux
```

The coverage report generator produces a zip file at
`bazel-out/_coverage/_coverage_report.dat` containing the HTML report, an LCOV export, and a text summary.

To extract the HTML report (works for both full and single-target runs):

```bash
bazel run //quality/coverage:generate_coverage_html
```

The report is written to `cpp_coverage_<platform>/index.html`. Open it with:

```bash
xdg-open cpp_coverage_linux/index.html
```

### Coverage Justifications

To achieve 100% effective coverage, lines and branches that cannot be covered by tests (defensive programming, tool false positives, etc.) can be *justified*. Justified lines and branches appear in **yellow/orange** in the HTML report (vs green=covered, red=uncovered).

Justifications are defined in [`quality/coverage/coverage_justifications.yaml`](coverage/coverage_justifications.yaml). A justification covers both the line itself and any branches on that line.

## Sanitizers

Address, undefined behavior, leak, and thread sanitizers are also available:

| Config | Sanitizers Enabled |
|--------|--------------------|
| `--config=asan` / `--config=ubsan` / `--config=lsan` | AddressSanitizer + UBSan + LeakSanitizer |
| `--config=tsan` | ThreadSanitizer |

> **Note:** `--config=asan`, `--config=ubsan`, and `--config=lsan` are all aliases
> for the same `asan_ubsan_lsan` configuration defined in `quality/sanitizer/sanitizer.bazelrc`.
> Each enables the identical set of sanitizers (ASan + UBSan + LSan).

### Running Sanitizers

```bash
bazel test --config=asan //...
bazel test --config=tsan //...
```

## Compiler Warnings

Compiler warning features are defined in [`quality/compiler_warnings/`](compiler_warnings/) and referenced in targets through the shared bundle in [`score/mw/common_features.bzl`](../score/mw/common_features.bzl). Warning features are prefixed with `score_communication_` to avoid collisions with other modules.

Features are enabled per-target via the `features` attribute. The LLVM toolchain enables `score_communication_minimal_warnings` by default (see [`MODULE.bazel`](../MODULE.bazel)).

### Adding Warning Features to a Target

Load the shared bundle and set it in your `cc_library` or `cc_unit_test`:

```starlark
load("//score/mw:common_features.bzl", "COMPILER_WARNING_FEATURES")

cc_library(
    name = "my_lib",
    srcs = ["my_lib.cpp"],
    hdrs = ["my_lib.h"],
    features = COMPILER_WARNING_FEATURES,
)
```

### Disabling Warnings for a Single Target

Use the `-` prefix to opt out of a feature on a specific target:

```starlark
cc_library(
    name = "third_party_wrapper",
    srcs = ["wrapper.cpp"],
    features = ["-score_communication_treat_warnings_as_errors"],
)
```

### Disabling a Feature Globally

Use `--features=-<feature_name>` on the command line:

```bash
bazel build //... --features=-score_communication_treat_warnings_as_errors
```

### Coverage Builds

Coverage builds (`bazel coverage //...`) automatically disable `-Werror` via [`quality/coverage.bazelrc`](coverage.bazelrc).
