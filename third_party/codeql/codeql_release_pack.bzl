"""Repository rule that vendors a pre-compiled CodeQL coding-standards pack.

The github/codeql-coding-standards project publishes, for every release, a
`coding-standards-codeql-packs.zip` asset that bundles each standard's query
pack **already compiled** (`.qlx` files plus all library dependencies vendored
under `.codeql/libraries/`). Using these avoids compiling the queries ourselves
(which is slow and, via `codeql pack create`, does not work inside Bazel's
sandbox), while still keeping the analysis hermetic and pinned: the download is
content-addressed by sha256 and the pack is fetched from the same release we pin
elsewhere.

The zip contains one `<standard>-coding-standards.tgz` per standard; this rule
extracts the requested one and exposes its contents as a `pack` filegroup whose
root is the pack directory (containing `qlpack.yml`, `codeql-suites/`, `rules/`
and `.codeql/libraries/`).
