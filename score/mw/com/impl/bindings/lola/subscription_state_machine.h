/// The state machine handles the user facing calls (SubscribeEvent(), UnsubscribeEvent(), SetReceiveHandler() etc.)
/// as well as the callbacks triggered by the IMessagePassingService.
///
/// The state machine conforms to the Run-to-completion execution model, meaning that each event or state machine method
/// completes before another can be called. An "Event" is a public member function which is modelled by the state
/// machine UML and causes a transition within the state machine. A "State Machine Method" is a function which depends
/// on the state of the state machine, but is not modelled by the UML and does not cause transitions in the state
/// machine (e.g. SetReceiveHandler, UnsetReceiveHandler).
///
/// A diagram of the state machine can be found in aas/mw/com/design/events_fields/proxy_event_state_machine.uxf
