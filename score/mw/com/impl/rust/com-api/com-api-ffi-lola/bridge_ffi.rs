// Why dynamic FFI bridge instead of static macros based -->
//
// DESIGN DECISION:  FFI Bridge for Compile-time decoupling of COM-API and Lola
//
// Problem with static macro based approach:
// - macros provides compile-time bindings tightly coupled with specific runtime
//   implementations
// - This violates COM-API design principle of being independent of any specific runtime
// - We cannot invoke macros defined in runtime-specific crates (like Lola, Mock) from COM-API
//   library which is runtime-agnostic
// - macros mixes two concerns: API abstraction (what to communicate)
//   and runtime binding (how to communicate)
//
// Why this file exists:
// - This file provides FFI bindings and bridge functions for COM API that work with Lola runtime
// - COM-API library is independent of any specific runtime implementation
// - bridge_ffi_rs.rs enables Rust COM-API to work with Lola's C++ implementation via FFI without
//   compile-time coupling
// - It uses type erasure and dynamic type resolution on C++ side to decouple compile-time
//   dependencies while still enabling type-safe communication
//
// Key design elements:
// - It defines opaque structs for Proxy and Skeleton base types (ProxyBase, SkeletonBase,
//   SkeletonEventBase)
// - Opaque types hide C++ implementation details and prevent accidental field access from Rust
// - It defines FFI functions for creating, destroying, and interacting with proxies and skeletons
// - String-based type identifiers (interface_id, event_id, event_type) enable runtime type checking
// - It provides Rust closure invocation function (mw_com_impl_call_dyn_ref_fnmut_sample) for
//   callbacks from C++
// - This allows C++ code to call back into Rust closures in type-erased manner using
//   FatPtr trait objects
// - Overall, this file serves as the FFI bridge layer for COM-API functionality
//
// How it works with C++:
// - extern "C" functions defined here are called via Lola APIs implemented in C++
// - FFI for C++ functions are implemented in registry_bridge_macro.cpp, which uses the type
//   registry to resolve operations at runtime
// - FFI C++ implementations are in registry_bridge_macro.cpp file
// - C++ side maintains type registry built by macros defined in registry_bridge_macro.h file
// - Registry is populated at application build time via-
//   auto-generated code for each interface and type
// - When Rust calls FFI functions with type name strings, C++ resolves type at runtime via registry
// - This enables type-safe communication without C++ needing to know Rust types at compile time
//
// Dependencies:
// - FatPtr provides binary representation of dyn trait objects (data pointer + vtable pointer)
// - common_ffi.rs holds the service-discovery types (InstanceSpecifier, HandleContainer) and their extern "C" declarations
//
// StringView:
// - StringView implementation is inspired by C++ std::string_view
// - It allows passing string data across FFI boundaries without requiring null termination
// - Enables efficient zero-copy string passing for interface_id, event_id, and type_name parameters
