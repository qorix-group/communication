For comfort reasons, we allow also the usage of abbreviated short-name-paths (short-name-paths with a number of components starting from root being removed) in case they are still unique within an executable (this json/configuration is a per executable config!). From AUTOSAR concept perspective an executable contains a 'root sw-component', which itself can be a nested composition of AdaptiveApplicationSwComponentTypes). Because of this 'compositing feature' it could be the case, that the direct short-name of a port prototype isn’t unique within the composition making up the executable. In reality however the port names are 95% unique and forcing the usage of lengthy short-name-paths can be annoying! So this translates to the following rules:\n1. A config file with two “instanceSpecifiers”, where one is only a trailing substring of the other is INVALID!\n2. If user code makes a resolve/lookup providing an 'instanceSpecifier' in the form of an abbreviated short-name-path, which turns out NOT being unique with respect to the config, this is a hard programming/configuration fault, which shall lead to an abort."
