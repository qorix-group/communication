Chapter 10: Access control for service instances
=================================================


Up to now in our tutorial we did not take care of access control to our service instances at all. Any consumer
application – running under whatever ``uid``/``gid`` – was able to consume the service instances our provider app
offered.

In real-world setups this is very unlikely to be acceptable. You do not want that an arbitrary application is able to
use a given service instance. Even leaving functional-safety concerns aside, you do not even want a service instance
provided in ASIL-QM quality to be consumed by arbitrary consumers. For a very simple reason: the provider has already
configured certain **resources** – think of ``maxSubscribers`` or ``numberOfSampleSlots`` used throughout the earlier
chapters. With this configuration the provider already made assumptions about *how many* consumers/subscribers will
consume a given event/field and *to which extent*. If some unknown/unexpected consumer showed up and subscribed to
certain service elements, it would occupy resources, which could lead to failures for the known/expected consumers
showing up later (their subscribe calls would be rejected because the resources are already exhausted). Thus, access
control is needed in real-world scenarios.

If you extend the discussion to functional-safety, the need for access control becomes even more obvious – to the point
that for ASIL-B applications, we **require** access control to be configured as part of our AoU (Assumptions of Use).

Access control in score::mw::com (and in the LoLa binding)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Access control is always something that has to be realized on the **binding layer**! Different technical bindings deploy
different access-control mechanisms. So the concrete question is: *what access-control mechanisms does our
LoLa/shared-memory binding provide?*

The LoLa binding uses two kinds of "communication channels" for which it has to provide access control:

- a **message-passing** layer, over which ``score::mw::com`` applications using the LoLa binding exchange messages, and
- **shared-memory objects**, to which both provider and consumer applications have access.

These basic building blocks can also be seen in the high-level architecture documentation, located
`here <https://eclipse-score.github.io/score/main/features/communication/ipc/docs/architecture/index.html>`__.

.. note::

   Currently we are **not** doing any access control on the message-passing level. The reason is that this is sometimes
   not possible at all, depending on the application's configuration. Access control is therefore realized on the
   shared-memory objects.

Access control is configured at the level of a **service instance** in the ``score::mw::com`` configuration file. For a
specific service instance you can define two properties, each carrying a list of ``uid``s separated by ASIL level:

- **allowedConsumer** defines which applications, in the role of a **consumer** (proxy), are allowed to access the
  service instance. This is defined at the **provider side** (provider-side configuration). In the LoLa binding the
  provider uses this list to restrict access to its shared-memory objects (via ACLs) to exactly the given ``uid``s.
- **allowedProvider** defines which applications are expected/allowed, in the role of a **provider** (skeleton), to
  provide the service instance. This is defined at the **consumer side** (consumer-side configuration). With this
  setting a consumer can make sure that it only accepts a verified/specific provider to consume the service from: when
  opening/mapping the shared-memory objects, the consumer checks that they are owned by one of the configured
  ``allowedProvider`` ``uid``s and terminates if that is not the case.

A few important rules:

- Only if a service instance is provided with ``asil-level`` = ``B``, separate ``uid`` lists for ``QM`` and ``B`` may be
  given. If a service instance is tagged with ``asil-level`` = ``QM``, only a ``QM`` list may be given in
  ``allowedConsumer`` / ``allowedProvider``.
- If a property ``allowedConsumer`` or ``allowedProvider`` is **omitted**, this means **no restrictions** regarding
  ``uid``s.
- If a property ``allowedConsumer`` or ``allowedProvider`` is an **empty list**, the meaning depends on the
  ``permission-checks`` property of the service instance (``file-permissions-on-empty`` – the default – falls back to
  basic ``ugo`` file-system rights; ``strict`` means really no-one is allowed). See the
  `configuration documentation <https://github.com/eclipse-score/communication/blob/main/score/mw/com/impl/configuration/README.md#serviceinstances>`__ for the details.

We base our sample code on the code from :doc:`chapter 2 <../chapter_2/README>`. The application code is **unchanged**;
only the two configuration files differ. The ``bazel`` project for this chapter is located in
``score/mw/com/doc/tutorial/chapter_10`` and contains the following files:

----------------------------------------

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


To show access control in action we adapt only the configuration of the provider and the consumer app.

On the **provider** side, we add an ``allowedConsumer`` property to the service instance ``MyHelloWorldServiceInstance``
and grant ``uid`` **778** (as the single allowed consumer) in the ``QM`` list:

.. literalinclude:: provider/mw_com_config.json
   :language: json
   :lines: 32-48
   :caption: provider/mw_com_config.json


On the **consumer** side, we add an ``allowedProvider`` property to the service instance ``MyHelloWorldServiceInstance``
and grant ``uid`` **777** (as the single accepted provider) in the ``QM`` list:

.. literalinclude:: consumer/consumer_config.json
   :language: json
   :lines: 32-41
   :caption: consumer/consumer_config.json


Note that both service instances are tagged ``asil-level`` = ``QM``, so only a ``QM`` list is allowed here. As explained
above, a ``B`` list would only be permitted (and required for freedom-from-interference) if the service instance were
provided in ASIL-B quality.

Provider application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The code for the provider application is **unchanged** compared to chapter 2. Only its configuration differs (the added
``allowedConsumer`` property).

Consumer application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The code for the consumer application is **unchanged** compared to chapter 2. Only its configuration differs (the added
``allowedProvider`` property).

How to run the example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


First build the two applications:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Build the provider and consumer targets
   bazel build //score/mw/com/doc/tutorial/chapter_10:provider-tar
   bazel build //score/mw/com/doc/tutorial/chapter_10:consumer-tar


Extract both archives (e.g. in a tmp-directory):

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir -p /tmp/tutorial/chapter_10
   tar -xf <project dir>/bazel-bin/score/mw/com/doc/tutorial/chapter_10/provider-tar.tar -C /tmp/tutorial/chapter_10/
   tar -xf <project dir>/bazel-bin/score/mw/com/doc/tutorial/chapter_10/consumer-tar.tar -C /tmp/tutorial/chapter_10/


Unlike the previous chapters, we now need to start the provider and consumer under **specific user-ids**, matching the
``uid``s we configured (``777`` for the provider, ``778`` for the consumer). The following steps require **root**
privileges (to create the users and to run a program as another user).

Create the two users with exactly the ``uid``s used in the configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Create a user 'provider777' with uid 777 and a user 'consumer778' with uid 778.
   sudo useradd --uid 777 --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin provider777
   sudo useradd --uid 778 --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin consumer778


Make sure both users can read/execute the extracted applications (they live under ``/tmp``, which is world-accessible by
default; adjust if you extracted elsewhere).

Now start the service-provider application as ``uid`` **777** in the 1st terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /tmp/tutorial/chapter_10/opt/HelloWorldServer
   sudo -u provider777 bin/provider_app


... and the service-consumer as ``uid`` **778** in the 2nd terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /tmp/tutorial/chapter_10/opt/HelloWorldClient
   sudo -u consumer778 bin/consumer_app --service_instance_manifest ./etc/consumer_config.json


With this **matching** setup everything works exactly as in chapter 2: the provider grants ``uid`` 778 access to its
shared-memory objects (via ``allowedConsumer``), and the consumer accepts the provider because it runs under ``uid`` 777
(which is in the consumer's ``allowedProvider`` list). The consumer creates the proxy and receives the "message" events.

Now try the **mismatching** cases and observe how access control kicks in:

- Start the **consumer under a different uid** than 778 (e.g. under your own user, or under ``provider777``). The
  provider's ``allowedConsumer`` ACL does not grant this ``uid`` access to the shared-memory objects, so the consumer is
  **not** able to open/map them and therefore **cannot create a proxy** to interact with the service instance.
- Start the **provider under a different uid** than 777 (e.g. under your own user, or under ``consumer778``). Now the
  shared-memory objects are owned by an unexpected ``uid``. The consumer – because it configured ``allowedProvider`` =
  ``[777]`` – detects that the objects are **not** owned by one of its accepted providers and refuses to use them, so
  again it **cannot create a proxy** to interact with the service instance.

In both mismatching cases the consumer fails to establish communication with the service instance, which is exactly the
access control we configured.

.. note::

   Running the two applications under the **same** ``uid`` (as we did in all earlier chapters) would only work if that
   ``uid`` happened to satisfy **both** lists (i.e. be ``777`` for the provider role *and* be ``778`` for the consumer
   role), which is impossible here since the lists are disjoint. This nicely illustrates that access control is enforced
   independently on both sides.

Summary
~~~~~~~


A short summary of what we have learned in this chapter:

- In real-world (and especially functional-safety) setups you must **not** let arbitrary applications access your
  service instances. Access control is needed to protect the provider's pre-allocated resources (e.g. ``maxSubscribers``,
  ``numberOfSampleSlots``) and, for ASIL-B, to preserve freedom from interference (it is part of our AoU).
- Access control is always realized on the **binding layer**. For the LoLa binding it is enforced on the
  **shared-memory objects** (the message-passing layer currently has no access control).
- Access control is configured per **service instance** via two properties:

  - ``allowedConsumer`` (provider-side): the ``uid``s allowed to *consume* the instance; enforced via ACLs on the
    provider's shared-memory objects.
  - ``allowedProvider`` (consumer-side): the ``uid``s the consumer accepts as *provider*; the consumer checks the
    ownership of the shared-memory objects and terminates on a mismatch.

- The ``uid`` lists are given per ASIL level (``QM``, and ``B`` only for ASIL-B service instances). An **omitted**
  property means *no restriction*; an **empty** list is interpreted according to the ``permission-checks`` property.
- If the running ``uid``s do not match the configured lists on either side, the consumer cannot create a proxy and
  communication is denied.
