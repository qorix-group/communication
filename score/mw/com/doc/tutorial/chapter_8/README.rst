Chapter 8: Methods - request/response communication
===================================================


All previous chapters dealt with *data-centric* communication: the provider **pushes** data (events, fields) to the
consumers, which react to it. This chapter introduces the other communication style `score::mw::com` offers:
**methods** – a classic *request/response* interaction. Here the **consumer** actively **invokes an operation** on
the provider and (optionally) receives a return value. Think of it as a remote procedure call (RPC)
(in the case of our LoLa binding IN-args and Result are exchanged over shared memory).

To show this we introduce a new service interface, the `CalculatorService`, which offers two methods:

- `add` – adds two 32-bit integers and returns their 64-bit sum. Its arguments are cheap scalars, so we call it
  using the convenient **copy** call operator.
- `arithmetic_mean` – computes the arithmetic mean of a (potentially large) array of integers. Its argument is
  deliberately large, so we call it using the **zero-copy** call operator (allocate the argument in place, fill it,
  then invoke), avoiding an unnecessary copy of the array.

The service interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Instead of `hello_world_service.h` / `tire_pressure_service.h` this chapter introduces `calculator_service.h` / `.cpp`.
A method is declared as `Trait::template Method<ReturnType(ArgTypes...)>` – i.e. simply by its function
signature. The member is constructed with a reference to the enclosing interface (`*this`) and the method name:

.. literalinclude:: calculator_service.h
   :language: cpp
   :lines: 79-94
   :caption: calculator_service.h


The second method takes a custom type `IntegerArray` as its argument:

.. literalinclude:: calculator_service.h
   :language: cpp
   :lines: 36-67
   :caption: calculator_service.h


A few important properties of a method argument/return type – and how they shaped `IntegerArray`:

- **It must be trivially copyable.** Method arguments and return values are transported through shared memory, where the
  middleware (de)serializes them via a plain `memcpy`. Therefore a method data type must not own heap memory
  (no `std::vector`, `std::string`, ...) and must not have a user-defined copy constructor/destructor. `IntegerArray`
  fulfils this by aggregating only a `std::array` and a `std::size_t`. We even guard this with a
  `static_assert(std::is_trivially_copyable_v<IntegerArray>)`.
- **It must be default-constructible.** The zero-copy call path (`Allocate()`, see below) default-constructs the
  argument inside the shared-memory slot before handing a pointer to it back to the caller. Because we also declared the
  `explicit IntegerArray(std::size_t)` constructor, the implicit default constructor is suppressed, so we bring it back
  explicitly via `IntegerArray() = default;`.
- **Fixed capacity.** As the argument lives in a fixed-size shared-memory slot, the array has a fixed maximum capacity
  (`max_elements`). How many of the leading elements actually carry a meaningful value is tracked separately in
  `number_of_elements_`, so a caller can transport "up to `max_elements`" integers while the receiver only processes the
  first `number_of_elements_` of them.

----------------------------------------

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Methods are configured similarly to events/fields, but under a `methods` array. In the **service type** binding each
method gets a `methodId`:

.. literalinclude:: provider/mw_com_config.json
   :language: json
   :lines: 9-24
   :caption: provider/mw_com_config.json


In the **service instance** each method gets a `queueSize`, which sizes the request/response queue of that method:

.. literalinclude:: provider/mw_com_config.json
   :language: json
   :lines: 35-51
   :caption: provider/mw_com_config.json


.. note::

   Note: The current method implementation does not yet support a method call queue size greater than 1, so `queueSize`
   is set to `1` here.

.. note::

   Note: In contrast to a field (where the consumer instance does **not** need to repeat the field deployment), a method
   **must** be listed in the `methods` array of the **consumer's** instance as well. Otherwise the proxy fails to set up
   the method binding (`Provided a method name which can not be found in LolaServiceInstanceDeployment`).
   This is because in the method case, the consumer side sets up the shared memory for the method related request/response
   queue.

.. note::

   Note: Each method deployment in the **consumer's** instance additionally supports an optional boolean ``use`` property
   (default ``true``). It is purely a matter of **resource tweaking** and is only evaluated on the proxy/consumer side.
   If you *know* that a particular consumer will never call a given method, set ``use`` to ``false`` for that method –
   the proxy then skips setting up the resources for it, which for the LoLa binding means it does **not** allocate the
   shared-memory of that method's request/response queue. Leaving it at the default ``true`` keeps the method callable.
   This is the exact same idea – with the same default polarity – behind the ``useGetIfAvailable`` /
   ``useSetIfAvailable`` properties of a field getter/setter (see :doc:`chapter 9 <../chapter_9/README>`): all three
   default to ``true``, i.e. the getter/setter (just like a method) is enabled by default and you *opt out* of it via
   ``useGetIfAvailable: false`` / ``useSetIfAvailable: false`` when you *know* that a particular consumer will never
   call the field's getter/setter.

Provider application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The provider creates a skeleton of type `AsSkeleton<CalculatorInterface>`, **registers a handler for every method** and
then offers the service. A handler is registered via `Method::RegisterHandler()`. With the current method API a handler
does **not** *return* the result. Instead, the return value is passed to the handler as its **first argument by
(mutable) reference** – i.e. as an *out-parameter* – followed by the (already deserialized) input arguments
by const-reference. The handler writes the result into that out-parameter and returns `void`. For a method signature
`ReturnType(ArgTypes...)` the expected handler signature therefore is `void(ReturnType&, const ArgTypes&...)`. Handlers
**must** be registered *before* the service is offered.

.. literalinclude:: provider/provider.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :lines: 61-92
   :caption: provider/provider.cpp


Note that the `arithmetic_mean` handler receives the large `IntegerArray` **by const-reference** – no copy of the
array happens on the provider side. A method provider is purely reactive: the registered handlers are invoked by the
middleware (on an internal thread) whenever a consumer calls a method. There is nothing to poll in `main()`, so –
just like the event-driven consumer of chapter 5 – the main thread simply blocks on a condition variable until a
termination signal (`SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`) requests the shut down; the signal handler sets a flag and notifies the
condition variable.

Consumer application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The consumer finds the single service instance via `StartFindService()` (exactly the same pattern as in chapter 5) and,
once it has created the proxy, performs the two method calls. It stops the discovery from within the find-service
handler, as a single proxy is all it needs.

1. Calling `add` with the copy call operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


For small, cheap-to-copy arguments the most convenient variant is the call operator that takes the arguments **by
const-reference**. The middleware allocates the argument slot, copies the arguments into it and performs the call:

.. literalinclude:: consumer/consumer.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :lines: 99-108
   :caption: consumer/consumer.cpp


2. Calling `arithmetic_mean` with the zero-copy call operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The `arithmetic_mean` method was designed specifically to carry a **potentially large argument**, where avoiding
unnecessary copies matters. For this we use the second call-operator overload, which takes `MethodInArgPtr<ArgTypes>...`
– i.e. pointers to the arguments *already sitting in the shared-memory slot*. The workflow is:

1. Call `Allocate()` on the method. On success it returns a tuple of `MethodInArgPtr`, one per argument, each pointing
   right into the shared-memory slot the argument will be transported in.
2. Fill the argument **in place** through that pointer – no copy of the large array is made.
3. Invoke the method with the (moved-out) argument pointer(s).

.. literalinclude:: consumer/consumer.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :lines: 119-126
   :caption: consumer/consumer.cpp


The copy call operator (variant 1) is, under the hood, just a convenience wrapper: it internally calls `Allocate()`,
copies the passed arguments into the allocated storage and then forwards to the zero-copy operator (variant 2). For a
large argument this "extra copy into the allocated storage" is exactly what we want to avoid – hence the explicit
`Allocate()`/fill/call sequence.

How to run the example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The steps are the same as in the previous chapters. The consumer uses the **implicit** configuration loading, so it is
started **without** the `--service_instance_manifest` argument.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Build the provider and consumer targets
   bazel build //score/mw/com/doc/tutorial/chapter_8:provider-tar
   bazel build //score/mw/com/doc/tutorial/chapter_8:consumer-tar


Extract both archives (e.g. in a tmp-directory):

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir -p /tmp/tutorial/chapter_8
   tar -xf <project dir>/bazel-bin/score/mw/com/doc/tutorial/chapter_8/provider-tar.tar -C /tmp/tutorial/chapter_8/
   tar -xf <project dir>/bazel-bin/score/mw/com/doc/tutorial/chapter_8/consumer-tar.tar -C /tmp/tutorial/chapter_8/


... then start the service-provider application in the 1st terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /tmp/tutorial/chapter_8/opt/CalculatorServer
   bin/provider_app


and the service-consumer in the 2nd terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /tmp/tutorial/chapter_8/opt/CalculatorClient
   bin/consumer_app


The consumer finds the service, creates the proxy, performs both method calls and then terminates on its own:

.. code-block:: text

   Found Calculator service instance (instance id: { ... "instanceId": 1 ... }). Creating proxy.
   Calling add(3438683060, 3685456342) using the copy call operator ...
   add returned: 7124139402
   Calling arithmetic_mean(...) using the zero-copy call operator ...
   arithmetic_mean over 500 elements returned: 52
   All method calls completed. Shutting down.
   Calculator service consumer going down.


... while the provider logs the incoming calls (it keeps running until it receives `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`):

.. code-block:: text

   OfferService: Calculator service instance is now offered. Waiting for method calls ...
   add(3438683060, 3685456342) = 7124139402
   arithmetic_mean over 500 elements = 52


Note how `add` correctly returns the 64-bit sum `7124139402`, which does not fit into a 32-bit integer – this is
why the method was declared to return `std::uint64_t` even though its arguments are `std::uint32_t`.

Summary
~~~~~~~


A short summary of what we have learned in this chapter:

- Besides the *data-centric* communication of the previous chapters (events/fields, where the **provider pushes** data),
  `score::mw::com` also offers **methods** – a classic *request/response* interaction where the **consumer
  invokes** an operation on the provider and (optionally) receives a return value (think of it as an RPC over shared
  memory).
- A method is declared within the service-interface by its function signature via
  `Trait::template Method<ReturnType(ArgTypes...)>`.
- A method argument/return type must be **trivially copyable** (it is transported through shared memory via `memcpy`, so
  no heap-owning members, no user-defined copy constructor/destructor) and **default-constructible** (the zero-copy
  `Allocate()` path default-constructs it in the shared-memory slot).
- On the **provider** side the implementation of the method is supplied via `Method::RegisterHandler()`, **before**
  `OfferService()`.
  The handler does **not** return the result to avoid copying; instead the return value is passed as its
  **first argument by (mutable) reference** (an out-parameter), followed by the input arguments by const-reference –
  i.e. the expected handler signature for `ReturnType(ArgTypes...)` is `void(ReturnType&, const ArgTypes&...)`.
- On the **consumer** side a method member is callable via `operator()`. There are two variants:
  - the **copy** call operator `proxy.method(args...)` – convenient for small, cheap-to-copy arguments (it
    internally `Allocate()`s, copies the arguments in and calls);
  - the **zero-copy** call operator `proxy.method(MethodInArgPtr...)` – for (potentially large) arguments: first
    `Allocate()` the argument directly in the shared-memory slot, fill it **in place**, then invoke the method with the
    obtained pointer(s), avoiding an extra copy.
- A method call returns a `score::Result`; on success it wraps a `MethodReturnTypePtr<ReturnType>` which is dereferenced
  to access the actual return value.
- Methods are configured under a `methods` array: `methodId` per method in the **service type** binding and `queueSize`
  per method in the **service instance**. Unlike a field/event, a method **must** also be fully declared in the `methods`
  array of the **consumer's** configuration instance, because in the case of methods resources (`queueSize`) are
  allocated on the consumer side.
- The current method implementation does not yet support a method call `queueSize` greater than `1`.
