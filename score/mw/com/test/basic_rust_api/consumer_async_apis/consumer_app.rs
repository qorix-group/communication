//! Consumer (proxy) binary for the BigData com-api SCT.
//! it use the async APIs for Service Discovery and Receive samples.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```
//! bigdata-consumer -n <num_cycles> -m <receive_mode>
//! ```
//! `-n <num_cycles>` — number of time try to receive samples before exiting (required).
//! `-m <receive_mode>` — which async receive mode to test: `with-cancellation`, `without-cancellation`, or `stream` (default: `without-cancellation`).
//! The consumer subscribes to the producer's `map_api_lanes_stamped_` output and
//! prints the `x` field of each received sample until it has received the specified number of samples, at which point it exits.
