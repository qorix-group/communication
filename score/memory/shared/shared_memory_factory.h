/**
 * @brief The SharedMemoryResource shall be instantiated only once per process. This is necessary
 *        since this object will mmap the shared memory into the process. If we would open the same
 *        shared memory twice, we would mmap it twice into the same process, which could cause
 *        odd behaviour.
 *        In order to overcome this issue, we decided to implement a Factory, which will ensure
 *        that we don't open the same shared memory twice.
 *
 * @details Open, Create, CreateOrOpen and Remove can be safely called concurrently. For each instance of
 *          SharedMemoryFactory (i.e. per process), only once will one of the calls (Open, Create or CreateOrOpen) of
 *          the underlying SharedMemoryResource be called. All other calls to Open, Create or CreateOrOpen will return a
 *          memory resource from the internal map.
 *          The parameters (except for allowedProviders) of the calls to Open, Create, and CreateOrOpen
 *          for the same path shall be consistent within the same process, as they will likely be ignored if the already
 *          existing instance is returned from the map.
