    ///          - named shared memory in system memory: A shared memory object is created and opened. The flags
    ///            parameter must contain `Fcntl::Open::kCreate`
    ///          - named shared memory in typed memory: A shared memory object (previously created by a call to
    ///            SharedMemoryResource::AllocateInTypedMemory) is opened. The flags parameter must not contain
    ///            `Fcntl::Open::kCreate`
    ///          - anonymous shared memory in system memory: A shared memory object is created and opened. The flags
    ///            parameter is ignored
    ///          - anonymous shared memory in typed memory: This method essentially does nothing because the shared
    ///            memory is already opened by the call to AllocateAndOpenAnonymousTypedMemory inside
    ///            SharedMemoryResource::AllocateInTypedMemory method. The reason for this is that typed memory client
    ///            API returns a shm_handle_t which is only available on QNX. Thus, allocating and opening both are
    ///            encapsulated in TypedMemoryImpl::AllocateAndOpenAnonymousTypedMemory to keep SharedMemoryResource
    ///            class clean from "#if defined __QNX__". The flags parameter is ignored
    /// \param flags Fcntl::Open flags used for creating / opening the shared memory. See details section for further
    ///              explanation
    /// \param mode Stat::Mode used for creating / opening the shared memory
    /// \todo This method needs refactoring
    /// \return Empty result in case of success, score::os::Error in case of error.
