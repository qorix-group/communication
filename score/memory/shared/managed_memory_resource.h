 *        MemoryResourceProxy.
 *        This MemoryResourceProxy can then be shared (e.g. over shared memory)
 *        and be used to identify a ManagedMemoryResource to allocate memory. This is always then necessary
 *        when the underlying memory_resource cannot be shared.
 *
 *        In our particular case the std::pmr::memory_resource cannot be shared over shared memory,
 *        since it include a v-table which is non-valid over process boundaries.
